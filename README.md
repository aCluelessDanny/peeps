**Peeps** is a small web app made for organizing Twitter lists. Basically, I wanted to use lists more on Twitter, but their built-in tools aren't exactly great, especially for multiple lists with decent sizes. So I decided to make my own interface focused on list management.

You can create, delete, & edit lists, as well as add and remove members within each of them.
