**Peeps** is a small web app made for organizing Twitter lists. Basically, I wanted to use lists more on Twitter, but their built-in tools aren't exactly great, especially for multiple lists with decent sizes. So I decided to make my own interface focused on list management.

You can create, delete, & edit lists, as well as add and remove members within each of them.

### For transparency's sake

This app does not store your data in any server, nor does it do anything malicious without your consent. The only things this app will do is read and write to your lists (and read your following list for improving the "Add members to list" search bar).

You can find all the Twitter API endpoints the app uses in the [api directory here](https://github.com/aCluelessDanny/peeps/tree/master/pages/api).

### Like the app a lot?
If you happen to like the web app and wanna show appreciation towards it, you can drop me a coffee here! I greatly appreciate any support:
